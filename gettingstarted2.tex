\begin{document}
\maketitle

This is a \link[\sf Ximera]{http://ximera.osu.edu} activity explaining how to get started with Ximera for instructors. 
Before you begin \link[\sf Ximera]{http://ximera.osu.edu}, you should be familiar with \LaTeX.
Ximera relies on \link[\tt github.com]{https://github.com} to host files.

You can get started by \link[clicking here]{http://497a6980.ngrok.com/course/hgpark21/gettingStarted2/master/whatisximera}. The activities include quite a bit of javascript, so you may have to wait a little while for the page to finish rendering.
