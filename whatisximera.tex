\link[\sf Ximera]{http://ximera.osu.edu} is an open-source software project that seeks to help course instructors create learning materials for their students in the form of interactive web pages and high quality PDF documents.
Our strategy to achieve this goal is to separate content from deployment.

An author writes content as a \LaTeX\ document.
This produces a PDF handout that can be distributed to students.
Next the author uploads the same \LaTeX\ file to \link[\tt github.com]{http://github.com},
a free web-based service providing a number of features to developers and authors.
In turn \link[\tt github.com]{http://github.com} delivers the file to the \link[\sf Ximera]{http://ximera.osu.edu} interpreter, which posts the file on the web.
The web page has essentially the same content as the handout.
However, the web page typically has interactive features not possible in the handout due to the physical limitations of paper.
For example, the web page might pose a question that if answered incorrectly, would offer hints or further questions
to the student.
This process is illustrated in the figure below.

\section{Benefits of Ximera}
One benefit of \link[\sf Ximera]{http://ximera.osu.edu} is that it provides an easy way to produce interactive online materials.
Another benefit is that many educators, particularly mathematicians, are already quite familiar with \LaTeX\ and
even find it easy to use. 
And because the \TeX\ language is extremely static in comparison with other programming and markup languages, authors can expect the \link[\sf Ximera]{http://ximera.osu.edu} materials they create to be usable in some form for the foreseeable future.

\section{Differences between Ximera and Learning Management Systems}

A Learning Management System (LMS) such as Blackboard or Moodle provides students with a central webpage from
which they can navigate to the webpage of each of their courses, these course web pages all formatted and laid out in exactly the same way.
Because of the possibility of conveying grades to students, an LMS requires students and instructors to have accounts,
which are typically set up by the college or University, as are the course web pages themselves.

By far, the most common way to use an LMS in our experience is to make announcements or to distribute files to students.  While this could be accomplished through email or simple web pages, the LMS, being largely set up by the college or University, provides an even easier way to distribute files and communicate with students.
It also organizes students' course materials in a single location.

The function of an LMS most relevant to our discussion of \link[\sf Ximera]{http://ximera.osu.edu} is assessment.
Instructors compose quizzes or homework assignments, which consist of sequences of questions of various types.
Typically each question has a unique answer, allowing the LMS to score the assignment and record grades in a
gradebook, another function of an LMS.
It should be borne in mind that composing questions for an LMS, particularly multiple-choice questions, creates a lot of work
for instructors. 
For this reason textbook publishers are increasingly bundling their books with accounts
on proprietary LMS's, from which an instructor can select precomposed exercises for students to complete.

In contrast \link[\sf Ximera]{http://ximera.osu.edu} provides a more flexible environment for creating course materials.
While an activity on an LMS consists solely of a sequence of problems, a \link[\sf Ximera]{http://ximera.osu.edu}
activity can contain whatever content a \LaTeX\ document can contain, and in addition, can include interactive questions
of various types.

\section{Ways Ximera can be used}
Whereas an LMS typically only supplements a traditional course, an entire course can be delivered through
\link[\sf Ximera]{http://ximera.osu.edu}.
For example, a course could consist of a sequence of \link[\sf Ximera]{http://ximera.osu.edu} activities, each of which primarily composed of text for students to read, with an occasional question sprinkled in to confirm and deepen students'
understanding of the material presented just before the question.
More substantial questions could appear at the end of the activity.

Another possibility is to use \link[\sf Ximera]{http://ximera.osu.edu} in conjunction with a traditional lecture-based course,
using \link[\sf Ximera]{http://ximera.osu.edu} to deliver pre-lecture reading materials and exercises to be completed by students before arriving to their lecture.
These could serve as a prelude to the lecture, perhaps presenting background topics or materials
to review before the lecture.

The emphasis of \link[\sf Ximera]{http://ximera.osu.edu} is more on content delivery than on assessment.
We understand however that many students function better knowing that their actions will be acknowledged by their instructors. We therefore envisage providing ways for instructors to access student scores on \link[\sf Ximera]{http://ximera.osu.edu} activities in the near future. In the meantime it might be better to use a traditional LMS to deliver exercises
if keeping track of student participation is important.
